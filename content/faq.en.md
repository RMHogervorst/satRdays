Common questions about satRdays

## 1. WHAT ARE SATRDAYS?
SatRdays are R-focused conferences that are held on Saturdays. They happen all over the globe, and are organised by local community leaders to help and grow the local community. There is a big emphasis on making these event accessible - by not requiring time off work, by not costing more than a console game, by being supportive of new community members or leaders.

## 2. WHERE ARE SATRDAYS HELD?
SatRdays are held all over the globe. The first was in Budapest, Hungary, and the next two will be in Cape Town, South Africa, and San Jose, Puerto Rico. These are heavily funded by the R Consortium and we're looking at the next set of events to be organised.

## 3. HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED?
There's so many ways you can get involved. If you're a techy who can contribute coding experience, we always need a hand developing our infrastructure. If you want to share your knowledge, why not put forward a session at an event near you. If you want to make the event near you a success, you can help organise it and make it run smoothly on the day by volunteering. If you want to run an event near you, let us know.

## 4. WHO FUNDS SATRDAYS?
The [R Consortium](https://r-consortium.org) are the primary funders of the SatRdays events. The Consortium is filled with companies doing great things for or with R. They're investing in growing the community and the support for the R language. Other fine companies are also getting involved by sponsoring or supporting local events.

## 5. HOW CAN I ORGANISE A SATRDAY?
We're still working out the best process for rolling out events, but you should come talk to us on [Slack](http://slack.satrdays.org) if you'd like to organise an event.

## 6. WHAT OTHER R EVENTS ARE OUT THERE?
- Find a local user group with this handy [directory](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html) from Revolution Analytics (now known as Microsoft!)
- There's [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) events
- There's conferences

## 7. WHAT MAKES SATRDAYS SO SPECIAL?
It depends who you ask! For some it's the local organisers, others the ability to learn from great speakers in your own time, and for others it's open platform for growing the community.
